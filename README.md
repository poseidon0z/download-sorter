# Folder Sorter

Use this program to sort any folder!

How to use:

1. Paste the folder_sorter.py and file_types.json files into the folder you wish to sort
2. Run the folder_sorter.py file. (Make sure you have python installed.)
3. Files are sorted into folders based on extensions

Read the file_types.json file to see supported types

Suggest new file types and extensions by creating an issue :D
